== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I've enabled the plugin but the prices are still not being hidden =

First, make sure that you've enabled the correct configuration to hide the product. If everything looks good, there is a slight chance that the theme you are using has a custom way of displaying price data that we're not able to override. Get in contact with the WP Geeks support team and we will assist in getting the plugin to work with your theme.
